           <h1>My Testimony</h1>
    </section>
    <h2>I was battling to find a garage that would give me excellent service and attention to detail. I looked online and was pleased to find Caritoon by Bogart the great specialising in German vehicles. A lot of other mechanics quoted me on the job I needed doing but weren’t entirely sure of what the problem was. When I spoke to the mechanic from Lakeside, he assured me that he knew exactly what the problem was and was able to quote me a price there and then. He had an excellent telephone manner and really made me feel comfortable leaving my car in his hands knowing it would be taken care of and that the problem would be rectified.
        When I brought the car in I was greeted by a group of kind and professional gentlemen who have a passion for cars and made me reassured that it would all be sorted. I was extremely impressed by their manner, professionalism, knowledge and courtesy that I would have no doubt in my mind that I will make Lakeside Garage my choice of garage in future. I have since recommended it to many others who have been very impressed with how quickly the job was done and how friendly and helpful the staff were. I only wish I had found you sooner!</h2>
